Despite the existence of a Dispute, the parties must continue to perform their respective obligations under this document and any related agreements.

Urgent Injunction. Nothing in this clause prevents either party from instituting court proceedings to seek urgent injunctive, interlocutory or declaratory relief in respect of a Dispute.

Arbitration.

AAA. If the dispute between the parties relating to or arising out of this agreement is not settled by the dispute resolution mechanism above, either party may by written notice to be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect.

Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis--class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in "small claims" court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.

Costs. Parties to the arbitration shall each pay an equal share of the costs and expenses of such arbitration, except as prohibited by law. Each party shall separately pay for its respective attorneys' fees and costs.

No Class Action. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your or others' unauthorized access to or use of the Services or content in violation of these terms you agree that we are entitled to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

general

Disclaimer. Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on any representation, warranty or statement made by any other party, other than as set out in this Agreement.

Relationship. The relationship of the parties to this Agreement does not form a joint venture or partnership.

Waiver. No clause of this Agreement will be deemed waived and no breach excused unless such waiver or consent is provided in writing.

Further Assurances. Each party must do anything necessary (including executing agreements and documents) to give full effect to this Agreement and the transaction facilitated by it.

Severability. Any clause of this Agreement, which is invalid or unenforceable is ineffective to the extent of the invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the remaining clauses of this Agreement.

Governing Law. These Terms, as well as the respective rights and obligations hereunder, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws principles. Please note that use of the Service by any User may be subject to other local, state, national, and international laws.

Each User expressly:

Agrees that exclusive jurisdiction for resolving any claim or dispute with Unomi relating in any way to use of the Service resides in the State of New York;

If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a United States federal government entity that is legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. In this event, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of New York (excluding choice of law).

Entire Agreement. The Terms, including any terms incorporated by reference into the Terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these Terms and any pages referenced in these Terms, the terms of these Terms will prevail.
